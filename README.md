# Image Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains an image classification project that utilizes deep learning techniques to classify images into predefined categories. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and can be used for various applications such as object recognition, medical imaging, and automated tagging.

## Features
- Preprocessing of image datasets
- Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Image augmentation for improved accuracy
- Deployment-ready model for real-world use cases

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classification.git
   cd image-classification
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
Ensure you have a dataset of images organized into folders by category. Update the `config.py` file to specify dataset paths.

## Usage
### Training the Model
Run the training script:
```sh
python train.py
```

### Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the trained model:
```sh
python evaluate.py
```

### Making Predictions
Use the trained model to classify new images:
```sh
python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Results
- Training accuracy: 0.7076
- Validation accuracy: 0.7110

## Future Improvements
- Improve model performance with additional data
- Experiment with different CNN architectures
- Implement transfer learning for better accuracy
- Deploy the model as a web API
